# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Began working on creating a To-do List application

**Thoughts:** Some of the JavaScript in the template I found is difficult to understand & change. I believe I will be able to within a few days though.

### Day 2: December 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I refined the to-do list app further and feel really confident in the look, but am working on adding functionallity and a better user-experience.

**Thoughts**: Complex vanilla JavaScript is making more sense thanks to Treehouse.

### Day 3: December 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: It was my goal to finish the to-do app today and send to a possible employer. I finished but think there are a few things I could have done better. Today is my first day of the JavaScript 30 challenge, where we build a drum web application.

**Thoughts** The more time I spend programming, the more proficient I feel. I've also been brainstorming a lot of little projects to work on that are relevant products that I need, not just practice.
